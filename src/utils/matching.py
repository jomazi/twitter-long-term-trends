def match(timeseries, memory=2, *, memory_weights=None, score_threshold=.1):
    """
    Matches community detections from single snapshots in a timeseries
    to get temporal communities that stretch over multiple timesteps.

    The jaccard index of the communities is taken as the matching
    strength. The Hungarian algorithm is used for the underlying matching
    (scipy implementation).

    When matching the current timestep, all communities up to (memory)
    timesteps in the past are taken into account. The current communities
    are scored against the past communities within the memory distance
    as well as against temporal communities that were already detected
    in the previous steps (also within the memory distance). In the later
    case, the sum of weighted jaccard indices is used as matching score.

    arguments:

    timeseries -- a list of dicts. each list item is a timestep and
    contains a dict. the keys are identifiers for the communities and the
    values are sets of identifiers for the community members. see example

    memory -- the number of timesteps to look back in the timeseries
    for matching.

    memory_weights -- memory kernel; a list of length (memory) with
    weights. if None is given, 1/i weighting is used so older communities
    have less influence on the matching score.

    score_threshold -- memory weighted jaccard indices under the
    threshold will not be included in the matching
